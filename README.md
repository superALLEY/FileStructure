## Introduction

This repository includes multiple C projects that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of different file structures, including:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Double Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Recursion
- And more...

Each project is intended to help you understand and apply various data structures and algorithms in C.

## Projects Overview

### Encryption & Decryption

This project involves a basic implementation of encryption and decryption algorithms, focusing on how to handle and process text data using C.

### File Structure Implementations

This project includes implementations and examples of various file structures and algorithms, such as:

- **Arrays**: Static data storage and management.
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data structures with node-based connections.
- **Double Linked Lists**: Advanced linked lists with bidirectional node connections.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structures.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structures.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures, including binary trees and others.
- **Recursion**: Techniques for solving problems through recursive function calls.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are utilized in the projects:

- **`<stdio.h>`**: Provides standard input and output functions for file and console operations.
- **`<string.h>`**: Contains string handling functions for manipulating and comparing strings.
- **`<conio.h>`**: Offers console input/output functions, including `getch()` for capturing user input (note: this is a non-standard header, mainly used in some DOS/Windows compilers).
- **`<windows.h>`**: Provides Windows-specific functions, including `Sleep()` for pausing execution and `system()` for executing system commands.

## How to Use
